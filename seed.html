  <h3>SEED TO SHELF:</h3>
  <p>At Global Green Company we believe in creating sustainable communities by building long-lasting relationships starting right at the level of the farmer. We support 20,000 farmers and their families in India and Hungary, year on year by providing a consistently profitable source of income. The seed to shelf model is the bedrock of making Global Green Company a socio-economically successful business.</p>

<p>We guide farmers right from the sourcing of seeds all the way through building sustainable farming models that are profitable and yield produce that makes its way to store-shelves and consumers tables. We ensure resource-control for, and have an on-ground dedicated support team working with farmers all-round the year, making us a leader at farm-sourcing globally.</p>
