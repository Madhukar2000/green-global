      <h3>Baby Corn</h3>
      <h5 style="color: black;">Baby Corn production demand is expanding worldwide, especially in Asia, Africa and South America, although historically and as of today, Asia still has the highest baby corn production and consumption globally.While still a recent development in India, many farmers in different parts of the country are taking up contract farming for baby corn. This is a very highly adapted crop and grows well in a wide range of soil types.Global Green Company, with its expertise in agriculture and processed food, introduced baby corn production to its portfolio of crop production in 2013. Our Oblapura facility in Karnataka, India, currently processes more than 500 metric tons of baby corn in retail packs (glass jars). Global Green Company is the only company in the world that is producing Fair Trade baby corn, which is currently being distributed and sold in Europe.</h5>

      <h3>Gherkins</h3>
       <h5 style="color: black;">India is the world’s largest exporter of gherkins, shipping approximately 200,000 metric tonnes, which accounts for 20% of total global gherkin exports. Mostly grown in the 3 southern states of India – Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh & Tamil Nadu, the climatic and soil conditions are favourable for two harvesting seasons, allowing for the distinct advantage of processing the produce for 10 months each year.<br>Global Green Company processes more than 35,000 tonnes of gherkins from its two facilities in India. With multi-product packing operations at both facilities and with the capability for both fresh and processed packs, we produce whole and cut produce in retail packs (glass jars and PET), foodservice packs (pouch and tins) and industrial packs (drums and pails).</h5>

      <h3>Green Peas</h3>
      <h5 style="color: black;">Hungary is at the southern part of the green pea growing belt in Europe. Our farmers ensure harvest of continuously fresh raw material within the short production cycle of around 30 days based on a carefully and meticulously created periodic sowing plan.A wide range of varieties bred in Hungary and neighbouring countries are available through Global Green Company. The Puszta plant processes 20 varieties of green peas, numbering 3,300 metric tonnes across 500 hectares.The wild pea is restricted to the Mediterranean basin and the Near East. The earliest archaeological finds of peas date from the late Neolithic era of current Greece, Syria, Turkey and Jordan. In Egypt, early finds date from c. 4800–4400 BC in the Nile delta area, and from c. 3800–3600 BC in Upper Egypt.</h5>

        <h3>Sour Cherries</h3>
        <h5 style="color: black;">Sour cherries, botanical name Prunus cerasus, are a natural occurring self-fertile hybrid between Prunus avium and Prunus fruticosa cherry trees. There are dozens of sour cherry tree varieties that mature at different intervals during the season, produce cherries with varying degrees of acidity and some varieties may be more suitable than others for cooking, drying or preserving. The most common sour cherry tree sold is the English Morello. Other less common but hardy and productive varieties include Balaton, Early Richmond, North Star and Montmorency, considered the best cherry for making cherry pies. Most sour cherries are not hand harvested, rather they are mechanically harvested, using a shaker to drop the fruit onto canvases where they flow into elevators and are placed into water tanks to rinse before packing.</h5>
